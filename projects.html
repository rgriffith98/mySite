            <h2>JavaScript using p5 Processing</h2>
            <p style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, .6); color:black;">This is one of my <strong>larger coding projects</strong>. I've ran through a lot of online tutorials and such when I learned how to use p5, so I'm counting that as a sort of project (all the programs I created during th learning process). Processing is a js project that using <strong>drawing tools</strong> on an html canvas. Its most advanced applications is <strong>data visualization</strong> through <strong>algorithmic programming</strong>. I talked about the project as an art form and the growing community behind it in one of my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rgriffith98" style="color:red;">blog posts</a>. As I mentioned, I have compiled my code into a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rgriffith98/JavaScript-Processing-with-p5" style="color:red;">Github repository</a> that is open to the public. I also plan to mention larger portions of these code samples that better and more specifically demonstrate the potential and scope of the <strong>p5 project</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Object Oriented Chess</h2>
            <p style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, .6); color:black;">This was a group (of two) <strong>final project</strong> for my Freshman <strong>Intermediate Programming</strong> Course. It is written in Object Oriented <strong>C++</strong> without the assistance of <strong>APIs</strong>. The game is playable in terminal and uses iostream graphics. The program includes clever save and load functions that allow for literally <strong>thousands</strong> of save files. You also have the option to set up your board any way you desire, so long as each color has only one king each. <strong>Castling</strong> is also supported.  Unfortunately, since this is a school project (for some reason professors don't make new homeworks or projects),  I am not able to make the code public due to <strong>academic ethics</strong> violations. However, if you are not a student who will need to take Intermediate programming at Hopkins, <strong>just email me</strong>, and I'm assume sharing the <strong>code</strong> with you would be appropriate. (My email is listed on the wite's homepage.) I can say that my <strong>partner</strong> and I received a <strong>119/100</strong>, which I think may have been the highest score in the class.</p>

            <h2>Language Modeling using Trigrams</h2>
            <p style="background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, .6); color:black;">This was a particularly <strong>large assignment</strong> for a  <strong>programming</strong> course. It is written in <strong>C and C++</strong> (again without the help of any <strong>APIs</strong>. <strong>Users upload</strong> two plain text files, and the program parses everything into <strong>trigrams</strong>. It them uses the probability of third word occurences to generate a user designated number of sentences. I had a lot of fun playing around with this. A few chapter of <strong>Nietzsche</strong> and the latest <strong>radio hit</strong> yielded the best results. Just like the previous project, since this is a school one,  I am not able to make the code <strong>public</strong> due to <strong>academic ethics</strong> violations. However, if you are not a student who will need to take Intermediate programming at Hopkins, <strong>just email me</strong>, and I'm assume sharing the <strong>code</strong> with you would be appropriate. (My email is listed on the wite's homepage.) Why don't <strong>professors</strong> just make new assignments so we can all <strong>show off</strong> our code to <strong>employers/the public</strong>? It takes some of the <strong>fun</strong> out of things</p>
