            <h2>JavaScript using p5 Processing</h2>
            <p style="color:white">This is one of my <strong>larger coding projects</strong>. 
		    I've ran through a lot of online tutorials and such when I learned how to use p5, so I'm counting that as a sort of project 
		    (all the programs I created during th learning process). Processing is a js project that using <strong>drawing tools</strong> 
		    on an html canvas. Its most advanced applications is <strong>data visualization</strong> through <strong>algorithmic 
		    programming</strong>. I talked about the project as an art form and the growing community behind it in one of my 
		    <a target="_blank" href="blogs/bl3.html" style="color:rgb(255, 215, 51);">blog posts</a>. As I mentioned, I have compiled my code 
		    into a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reecewgriffith/JavaScript-Processing-with-p5" style="color:rgb(255, 215, 51);">Github repository</a> 
		    that is open to the public. I also plan to mention larger portions of these code samples that better and more specifically demonstrate 
		    rthe potential and scope of the <strong>p5 project</strong>.</p>

            <h2>synoPTsis</h2>
	    <p style="color:white">synoPTsis is a <strong>Johns Hopkins</strong> University Applied Physics Lab 
		    <strong>startup</strong> that is working to streamline (through an android a iOS application) <strong>pateint data</strong> to allow 
		    physicians to more efficiently treat patients at the <strong>Johns Hopkins Hospital</strong>. I have been working as a <strong>front-end
		    developer</strong> at the company <strong>since June</strong> of <strong>2017</strong>. While my main duties consisted of building the 
		    <strong>user interface</strong> for the app, I spent a decent amount of time working on porting backend code to make requests to our 
		    <strong>server</strong>. I worked with <a target="_blank" href="http://ionicframework.com" style="color:rgb(255, 215, 51);">Ionic</a> 
		    (a cross compiling framework) to <strong>synchronously</strong> build the
		    front-end of the <strong>android</strong> and <strong>iOS</strong> application. As I mentioned, I helped connect the server (using 
		    <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/" style="color:rgb(255, 215, 51);">Google Protobuf</a>) to display certain pieces of data. I also designed some charts for the <strong>vitals</strong> section 
		    of the app using the <strong>Chart.js API</strong>. Since this is a <strong>private project</strong>, I am not at liberty to share code 
		    publicly. However, if you are an employer, I'm sure the person in charge would allow me to share it for professional purposes. (Just shoot 
		    me an <strong>email</strong>).</p>

            <h2>Object Oriented Chess</h2>
            <p style="color:white">This was a group (of two) 
		    <strong>final project</strong> for my Freshman <strong>Intermediate Programming</strong> 
		    Course. It is written in Object Oriented <strong>C++</strong> without the assistance of 
		    <strong>APIs</strong>. The game is playable in terminal and uses iostream graphics. The 
		    program includes clever save and load functions that allow for literally <strong>thousands</strong> 
		    of save files. You also have the option to set up your board any way you desire, so long as each 
		    color has only one king each. <strong>Castling</strong> is also supported.  Unfortunately, since 
		    this is a school project (for some reason professors don't make new homeworks or projects),  I am 
		    not able to make the code public due to <strong>academic ethics</strong> violations. However, if you 
		    are not a student who will need to take Intermediate programming at Hopkins, <strong>just email me</strong>, 
		    and I'd assume sharing the <strong>code</strong> with you would be appropriate. (My email is listed on the 
		    wite's homepage.) I can say that my <strong>partner</strong> and I received a <strong>119/100</strong>, which 
		    I think may have been the highest score in the class.</p>

            <h2>Language Modeling using Trigrams</h2>
            <p style="color:white">This was a particularly 
		    <strong>large assignment</strong> for a  <strong>programming</strong> course. It is
		    written in <strong>C and C++</strong> (again without the help of any <strong>APIs</strong>.
		    <strong>Users upload</strong> two plain text files, and the program parses everything into
		    <strong>trigrams</strong>. It them uses the probability of third word occurences to generate
		    a user designated number of sentences. I had a lot of fun playing around with this. A chapter
		    or so of <strong>Nietzsche</strong> and the latest <strong>radio hit</strong> yielded the 
		    best results. Just like the previous project, since this is a university-related one,  I am 
		    not able to make the code <strong>public</strong> due to <strong>academic ethics</strong> 
		    violations. However, if you are not a student who will need to take Intermediate programming 
		    at Hopkins, <strong>just email me</strong>, and I'd assume sharing the <strong>code</strong> 
		    with you would be appropriate. (My email is listed on the wite's homepage.) Why don't
		    <strong>professors</strong> just make new assignments so we can all <strong>show off</strong>
		    our code to <strong>employers/the public</strong>? It takes some of the <strong>fun</strong> 
		    out of things.</p>

            <h2>Python Web Crawlers</h2>
		<p style="color:white">Some of the <strong>most exciting</strong> things I did with programming (early 
			on) was building <strong>web crawlers</strong>. Here are my favorites (using <strong>python 3</strong> and Beautiful Soup). 1) <strong>Internship.com</strong> 
			Crawler: I built this in my first semester of freshman year. Internships seemed increasingly important for 
			<strong>CS majors</strong>, especialy at Hopkins where people are so competetive. 
			I made this crawler to go through all availiable internship <strong>positions</strong> from Internship.com, one of the <strong>worlds largest</strong> 
			internship posting sites. I liked it and used it so much, that I added in a <strong>filtering</strong> feature that allows you to select 
			interships by major. I sent it to some of my friends, and they ended up using it too. I actually didn't choose an internship 
			from this site, because I found a great fit at <strong>synoPTsis</strong> (listed towards the top of the page). 2) <strong>Reddit</strong> Hot Word: I built this crawler during my 
			second semester of freshman year. Free time is extremely <strong>rare</strong> in college and even more so when you're an <strong>engineer</strong>. This crawler 
			creawls through Reddit's front page and lists the <strong>most used</strong> word of the day. It was really fun to use around election season. 
			The code for both crawlers can be found at these Github Repos: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reecewgriffith/Internship.com-Crawler" style="color:rgb(255, 215, 51)">(1)</a> 
			and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/reecewgriffith/Reddit-Hot-Word" style="color:rgb(255, 215, 51)">(2)</a>. 
			I think python is a great intro to programming, and webcrawlers 
			are a fun way to see the results of your work. (I still think the best intro to programming is 
			<strong>JavaScript p5</strong>. See this <a target="_blank" href="blogs/bl3.html" style="color:rgb(255, 215, 51)">blog post</a> 
			for more.)</p>
