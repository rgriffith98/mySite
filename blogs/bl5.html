            <h2 align="left">The City</h2>

            <h3 align="left">
                &emsp;&emsp;This blog post is a late one. During my freshman year of college,
                a few friends and I took a trip to New York City for <strong>spring break</strong>. We managed to find an 
                airbnb for $175 (per person) for 2 nights. It wasn't a bad deal considering
                that the average rent in the city is about $4k. We did all the typical tourist
                things: Empire State Building, SoHo, <strong>Times Square</strong>, K-Town, et cetera. The city
                was like nothing I'd ever seen before, even with living a few hours outside of 
                <strong>Los Angeles</strong> my whole life.
            </h3>


            <h3 align="left">
                &emsp;&emsp;I don't know if I would be able to live in the city or any city for
                that matter. It's a little too busy. After a few days, I felt a little more
                irritable than usual. I learned later that semester, in my 
                <strong>Social Psychology</strong> class, that people in closer or confined 
                spaces are much more likely to be frustrated or angry. This got me thinking 
                about where I want to live after <strong>graduation</strong>.

            <h3 align="left">
                &emsp;&emsp;I've come to the conclusion that I'm going to live just outside of a city
                â€” like in a suburb or townhouse maybe. This seems like a good way to get away from 
                the stress of the <strong>city</strong>. It'll also help cut housing costs a bit, which will hopefully 
                outweigh the added travel costs involved with living away from the city (where I'll 
                most likely work with a CS degree) When I say "city", I am speaking generally. I'm 
                shooting for the West Coast. Most of my family is there, and it's just something I'm 
                used to as a Californian. <strong>Seattle</strong> or <strong>San Fran</strong> for me!

                &emsp;&emsp;As an added bonus, here is a review I wrote for the best restaraunt we visited on the trip: 
                Max Brenner's New York - I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. It gets an 10/10 across the board.
                Everything about this place was just perfect. Their hot chocolates are a must for any new visitor. I had something 
                from their breakfast menu, which was fantastic. Every order comes with buttered french bread and a side of 
                melted chocolate. It's also the home of the famous American chef David Burke, so it's definitely something to try 
                if you're in the city. Prices were high, about $30 a person, but this was made up for with large portions and great food.
