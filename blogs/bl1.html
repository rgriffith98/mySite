				 &emsp;&emsp;I started writing, seriously, in my senior year of highschool. 
				My best friend Darrell had been talking about this app called "Wattpad" 
				for a few weeks, so I checked it out. It's basically the social media of 
				writing. Millions of users coming together to share their work with 
				others. Darrell was already about 5,000 words into his book; I think it 
				was going to be a novel.

                            &emsp;&emsp;I had to catch up quick. I didn't have my own computer until after 
				highschool, because money was always a little tight. I  also didn't really 
				want to announce to my family that I was writing a book by using the home 
				computer, so I used my  smartphone to write over <strong>25,000 words</strong> over the 
				course of a few months. I really loved it, creating something tangible with 
				only a keyboard. I think thats something that always drew me to computer
				science.

                            &emsp;&emsp;I really enjoy being able to create something from nothing. A few of
				my friends cs major friends want to go into economics. At first I thought it
				sounded exciting to be working in such a dynamic and seemingly unpredictable
				field, but in a lot of situations (especially on Wall Street where most 
				CS/Econ majors end up) it's really just a <strong>zero sum</strong> game. I don't want to work
				in an industry where nothing is truly gained. Any victory in economics was a
				loss for someone else. With computer science, and writing too, I can sit at
				a desk and create something that didn't exist until I created it. It's a
				wonderful feeling to be able to add to the universe, rather than taking from
				something that was already here.

                            &emsp;&emsp;Anyways, in the words of one of my favorite authors, Yann Martel
				<strong>"Unfortunately, the novel sputtered, coughed and died."</strong>
				It was towards the middle of the year. I decided to revise the first, I
				believe it was the first nine chapters of the book. I wanted to write
				something with meaning, and I didn't like what I had so far. It was way
				too commercial, and I didn't see a way of fixing it. I unpublished it
				from Wattpad for a few days, while I thought about how to fix it.
				Eventually, I gave up and deleted it comletely.

                            &emsp;&emsp;I've since learned to be less critical, and, like developing
				anything, whether it be a piece of software or a story, it's a process
				that takes times to master and perfect. Just try writing. It is the rare individual that sits
				down and creates a masterpiece. Just give it a try. Even <strong>Hemingway</strong> wasn't born a 
				great writer. In fact, Hemingway was a <strong>drunk</strong>, but I'm sure he still worked
				hard at his craft. That said, if you're sober, you've already got a leg up on one of the
				greatest writers in history. All joking aside, just go out and <strong>try it</strong>.

                            &emsp;&emsp;I still write the occasional short story or poem, and I hope
				to finish a novel someday. It's all posted on my
