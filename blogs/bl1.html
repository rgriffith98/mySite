                            2016 August,
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            &emsp;&emsp;I started writing, seriously, in my senior year of highschool. My best friend Darrell had been talking about this app called "Wattpad" for a few weeks, so I checked it out. It's basically the social media of writing. Millions of users coming together to share their work with others. Darrell was already about 5,000 words into his book; I think it was going to be a novel.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            &emsp;&emsp;I had to catch up quick. I didn't have my own computer until after highschool, because money was always a little tight. I  also didn't really want to announce to my family that I was writing a book by using the home computer, so I used my  smartphone to write over 25,000 words over the course of a few months. I really loved it, creating something tangible with only a keyboard. I think thats something that always drew me to computer science.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            &emsp;&emsp;I really enjoy being able to create something from nothing. A few of my friends cs major friends want to go into economics. At first I thought it sounded exciting to be working in such a dynamic and seemingly unpredictable field, but in a lot of situations (especially on Wall Street where most CS/Econ majors end up) it's really just a zero sum game. I don't want to work in an industry where nothing is truly gained. Any victory in economics was a loss for someone else. With computer science, and writing too, I can sit at a desk and create something that didn't exist until I created it. It's a wonderful feeling to be able to add to the universe, rather than taking from something that was already here.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            &emsp;&emsp;Anyways, in the words of one of my favorite authors, Yann Martel <strong>"Unfortunately, the novel sputtered, coughed and died."</strong> It was towards the middle of the year. I decided to revise the first, I believe it was the first nine chapters of the book. I wanted to write something with meaning, and I didn't like what I had so far. It was way too commercial, and I didn't see a way of fixing it. I unpublished it from Wattpad for a few days, while I thought about how to fix it. Eventually, I gave up and deleted it comletely.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            &emsp;&emsp;I've since learned to be less critical, and, like developing anything, whether it be a piece of software or a story, it's a process that takes times to master and perfect.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            &emsp;&emsp;I still write the occasional short story or poem, and I hope to finish a novel someday. It's all posted on my Wattpad. Here's the <a style="color:red;" href="https://www.wattpad.com/user/rgriffith98">link</a>.
