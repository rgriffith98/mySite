            <h3 align="left">
                &emsp;&emsp;I started writing, seriously, in my senior year of highschool. 
                My best friend Darrell had been talking about this app called "Wattpad" 
                for a few weeks, so I checked it out. It's basically the social media of 
                writing. Millions of users coming together to share their work with 
                others. Darrell was already about 5,000 words into his book; I think it 
                was going to be a novel.
            </h3>


            <h3 align="left"> 
                &emsp;&emsp;I had to catch up quick. I didn't have my own computer until after 
                highschool, because money was always a little tight. I  also didn't really 
                want to announce to my family that I was writing a book by using the home 
                computer, so I used my  smartphone to write over <strong>25,000 words</strong> over the 
                course of a few months. I really loved it, creating something tangible with 
                only a keyboard. I think thats something that always drew me to computer
                science.
            </h3>

            <h3 align="left">
                &emsp;&emsp;I really enjoy being able to create something from nothing. A few of
                my friends cs major friends want to go into economics. At first I thought it
                sounded exciting to be working in such a dynamic and seemingly unpredictable
                field, but in a lot of situations (especially on Wall Street where most 
                CS/Econ majors end up) it's really just a <strong>zero sum</strong> game. I don't want to work
                in an industry where nothing is truly gained. Any victory in economics was a
                loss for someone else. With computer science, and writing too, I can sit at
                a desk and create something that didn't exist until I created it. It's a
                wonderful feeling to be able to add to the universe, rather than taking from
                something that was already here.
            </h3>

            <h3 align="left">
                &emsp;&emsp;Anyways, in the words of one of my favorite authors, Yann Martel
                <strong>"Unfortunately, the novel sputtered, coughed and died."</strong>
                It was towards the middle of the year. I decided to revise the first, I
                believe it was the first nine chapters of the book. I wanted to write
                something with meaning, and I didn't like what I had so far. It was way
                too commercial, and I didn't see a way of fixing it. I unpublished it
                from Wattpad for a few days, while I thought about how to fix it.
                Eventually, I gave up and deleted it comletely.
            </h3>


            <h3 align="left">
                &emsp;&emsp;I've since learned to be less critical, and, like developing
                anything, whether it be a piece of software or a story, it's a process
                that takes times to master and perfect. Just try writing. It is the rare individual that sits
                down and creates a masterpiece. Just give it a try. Even <strong>Hemingway</strong> wasn't born a 
                great writer. In fact, Hemingway was a <strong>drunk</strong>, but I'm sure he still worked
                hard at his craft. That said, if you're sober, you've already got a leg up on one of the
                greatest writers in history. All joking aside, just go out and <strong>try it</strong>.
            </h3>

            <h3 align="left">
                &emsp;&emsp;I still write the occasional short story or poem, and I hope
                to finish a novel someday. It's all posted on my
