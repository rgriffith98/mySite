				&emsp;&emsp;This this summer is propably the last time I will be home (maybe besides winter break), 
				we decided to take my dog to the beach. It seemed like the stereotypical number one spot on the dog 
				bucket list.

				&emsp;&emsp;We went to Hunnington Beach Dog Park. It was the shortest drive and had the highest ratings. 
				The beach was huge. I expecting maybe a few hundred yards, but it was at least a mile long. Parking was 
				cheap (only $1.75/hour). Everyone was really friendly. Dogs who werent well trained were kept on leash. 
				Also, if you're worried your dog might not like the cold water, they'll at least enjoy running around 
				with the other dogs. 5 stars ~
