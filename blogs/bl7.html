				&emsp;&emsp;This summer is propably the last time I will be home (maybe besides winter break), 
				so we decided to take my dog to the beach. It seemed like the stereotypical number one spot on the dog 
				bucket list.
			</h3>
                            
			<h3 align="left">
				&emsp;&emsp;We went to Hunnington Beach Dog Park. It was the shortest drive and had the highest ratings. 
				The beach was huge. I expecting maybe a few hundred yards, but it was at least a mile long. Parking was 
				cheap (only $1.75/hour), and everyone was really friendly. Dogs who weren't well trained were kept on leashes. 
				Also, if you're worried your dog might not like the cold water, they'll at least enjoy running around 
				with the other dogs.
			</h3>
						
			<h3 align="left">
				&emsp;&emsp;My dog did a little of both. He was really unsure of everything at first. He has never seen 
				an ocean or even that many dogs. He kept looking up at us; it was like he was seeing if his next move would 
				be okay with us/safe. He ended up going chest deep in the water, which for him is about eight inches. We 
				stayed for 4 hours, but any dog will be tired after two or three. If you pack a lunch, get there early 
				for cheap and nearby parking, you can get out of this trip for just the price of gas plus less than ten dollars 
				for parking. 5/5 stars. If you have a dog, this is definitely something to try. It's best to go when it's 
				overcast. Your pet might get too hot otherwise.

				Here is a <a href="http://www.dogbeach.org" style="color:rgba(255, 215, 51, .6)">link </a>
				to their website with some helpful tips for first time visitors. They're also looking for volunteers, 
				that is â€” if you like spending your summers with dozens of dogs on the beach.
