                         <h3 align="left">
				 &emsp;&emsp;I decided to answer some questions as a sort of get to know me post.
				 If you have any additional questions, leave them in the comments for me to answer!

		<div align="left">
						
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: If you didn’t have to sleep, what would you do with the extra time?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: In my senior year high school, I was reading a few books a month. I was also writing 
				a lot for my own enjoyment. I'd like to do that more.
			</h3>
			<br>
			
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: What’s your favorite piece of clothing you own / owned?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: I can't really pick just one. I have three items, each obtained a different way.
				<ul>
  					<li>Adidas Gonz Shoes (purchased): pink leather skate shoes, they have poems by the designer scattered on the shoe, haven't seen anything else like them</li>
  					<li>Vintage Wrangler Jean Jacket (thrifted): wool collar and lined, never went out of style in my opinion</li>
  					<li>1989 Baltimore Orioles Baseball Hat (handed down): My dad gave me this hat when I left to Baltimore for college, immense sentimental value</li>
				</ul>
			</h3>
			<br>
		
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: What hobby would you get into if time and money weren’t an issue?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: I'd probably just sit out on a small boat on the Pacific Ocean and just write stories, poems, ect.</h3>
			<br>
						
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: What would your perfect room look like?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: My room was always really cluttered growing up. 
				I suppose I could have kep it more organized, but I feel like the 
				easiest fix would be to have less stuff. That's why I plan on having 
				a really minimalistic room/home. My room would have a small desk 
				with my laptop and some supplies. My bed would be simple, with a small, 
				simple bedset with a blanket at the foot. It'd have a lot of natural light, 
				maybe a small book case built into the wall, and a small nightstand.</h3>
			<br>
						
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: How often do you play sports?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: I played multiple varsity sports throughout 
				high school but that went down to intramurals in college. 
				Every month or so, I play a pick up basketball game with my 
				friends too. (I would definitely play more, if I had the time.)
			</h3>
			<br>
						
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: What fictional place would you most like to go?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: Atlantis.</h3>
			<br>
						
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: What job would you be terrible at?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: Anything menial or anything without a dynamic workplace.
				I can't really think of a specific job. I just know I wouldn't be able to 
				enjoy myself, if everyday was exactly the same.</h3>
			<br>
						
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: When was the last time you climbed a tree?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: Probably sophomore year of high school, when I was hanging out 
				my good buddy Darrell.</h3>
			<br>
						
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: If you could turn any activity into an Olympic sport, what would you have a good chance at winning medal for?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: Maybe public speaking. I've always felt that I had a 
				natural talent for it.
			</h3>
			<br>
						
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: What is the most annoying habit that other people have?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: Complacency. I went to a high school with a lot of 
				unmotivated people and sometimes it got on my nerves.
			</h3>
			<br>
						
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: What job do you think you’d be really good at?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: I think I'd be a great Project Manager. I really like the 
				entrepreneurial spirit of the workplace. I have experience all up and down 
				the stack, and I also have leadership experience with CS related 
				activities/clubs/projects. Testing the code and seeing something really tangible 
				after a few weeks is the most satisfying feeling I've ever had (I realized 
				this during my work with synoPTsis.)
			</h3>
			<br>
			
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: What skill would you like to master?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: I'd like to play an instrument really well. Sometimes 
				I wish I was brought up taking lessons, instead of self-teaching.</h3>
			<br>
		
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: What would be the most amazing adventure to go on?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: Maybe to visit every country in the world one year, 
				or maybe go train hopping and just see where I end up. One of my old 
				football coaches used to just drive in random directions every summer. 
				I guess he got as far as the East Coast all the way from California a 
				few times. Doing that might be fun too.</h3>
			<br>
						
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: If you had unlimited funds to build a house that you would live in for the rest of your life, what would the finished house be like?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: I'm just gonna make a list — it's easier.
				<ul>
					<li>Two Story Library/Reading Room</li>
					<li>Media Room (like a home theater)</li>
					<li>Office</li>
					<li>Master Bedroom and Bathroom (obviously)</li>
					<li>Living room with lots of seating, large TV and sound system, and a grand piano</li>
					<li>Home Gym</li>
					<li>Art Room (with painting supplies et cetera, because it's relaxing)</li>
					<li>Arcade (with those vintage stand up arcade games)</li>
					<li>A couple guest rooms and bathrooms</li>
					<li>Big Kitchen with a Bar</li>
					<li>Outdoor BBQ, pool, jacuzzi</li>

                        <h3 style="color:white">A: I remember traveling through Ohio when I was about

				seemed pretty irritable too.
			</h3>

                        <h3 style="color:white">A: Probably Star Wars. It's so big that you'd probably 
				get a taste of everything.
			</h3>

			<h3 style="color:red">Q: What do you consider to be your best find?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: I found a $100 Coach baseball hat on sale for $25. 
				I'm sure there's something better, but that's all that comes to mind.</h3>
			<br>
						
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: Are you usually early or late?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: On time.</h3>

			<h3 style="color:red">Q: What takes up too much of your time?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: CS problem sets take up a lot of time, but I can't really complain about 
				learning. I guess sometimes I stress about really pointless things, like if 
				I left the water on or if I didn't lock my car — things I'm sure I did, but for some 
				reason stress over. I've gotten better about it though.
			</h3>
			<br>
			
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: What do you wish you knew more about?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: I wish I knew more about the different cultures of the 
				world. I haven't really had the opportunity to travel outsude of the U.S. 
				just yet, so I'm sure that's the root of the issue. I've learned a lot

                        <h3 style="color:white">A: Freshman year, it was always nice to get to use the larger shower 
				in our dorm (the bathrooms were communal). Getting out of Social Psychology early ws also nice 
				(we often did). Seeing my friend Zach on the way to my CS research seminar (this was 
				a more rare occasion).</h3>
			<br>
						
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: Who’s your go to band or artist when you can’t decide on something to listen to?</h3>

			<br>
						
			<h3 style="color:red">Q: Who has impressed you most with what they’ve accomplished?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: I'm gonna keep this to people I know personally. It's probably 
				my grandpa's. My mom's father worked realy hard and came to this country as an immigrant, 
				He worked for a trucking company for a little bit, then started managing properties. 
				He even owned 10+ properties at one time and paid for a few houses in cash. My dad's

				terrible to ignore — one of the worst shows I have ever seen.</h3>

                        <h3 style="color:white">A: Relaxing at the beach, or exploring a new city.</h3>

                        <h3 style="color:white">A: I use California slang. (It's not as stereotypical as

                        <h3 style="color:white">A: Fluorescent clothing from the 80s. I think it'd 
				hilarious to see everyone walking around looking like they're in 
				an 80s teen movie. Plus I have a decent amount of that stlye of clothing, 
				because I go thrifting every so often.

                        <h3 style="color:white">A: I really enjoy renaissance art. It focused on skill and technique rather

                        <h3 style="color:white">A: Growing up, I was interested in all fields of science. I could 
				never pick just one. The more research I did, I found that computer science played 
				a key role in every field, even beyond scientific ones. I started programming over 
				summers and I never looked back.</h3>

			<h3 style="color:red">Q: What is the luckiest thing that has happened to you?</h3>
                        <h3 style="color:white">A: I'll asnwer this one with a quote by Richard Dawkins – 
				<p style="color:white">“We are going to die, 
				and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going 
				to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never 
				see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include 
				greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible 
				people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these 
				stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.We privileged few, who won the 
				lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state 
				from which the vast majority have never stirred?”</p>

                        <h3 style="color:white">A: Still California, but near the beach. Everyone

				I'm from the California Desert.</h3>
