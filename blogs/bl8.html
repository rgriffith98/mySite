				to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never 
				see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include 
				greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible 
				people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these 
				stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.We privileged few, who won the 
				lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state 
				from which the vast majority have never stirred?”</p>
