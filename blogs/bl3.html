                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            &emsp;&emsp;Recently, I discovered a project for JavaScript called "processing". The original goal of this project was to make coding more accessible to designers, artists, and educators. It allows you to really visualize what your code/data is doing.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            &emsp;&emsp;However, the project has exploded, and very experienced developers now use it for things like data visualization and graphics. I started learning the basics and Ive been hooked ever since. There is a growing community that uses p5 to make art pieces that I really fell in love with. Don't get me wrong, coding is fun, and there most definitely is beauty in writing and devloping code, but p5 allows you to create abstract pieces of art like a painter on a canvas would. With complex algorithmi programming, you can create works of art while still learning about the algorithms/lines of code you just used in a fun and much more visual way. If any of this sounds interesting to you, <a style="color:red;" href="https://www.openprocessing.org/browse/#">here</a> is a link to the commmunity of developers and their top p5 pieces.
                            
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            
                            &emsp;&emsp;As I said, I also dabble in p5 and have created a couple of pieces myself. You can see my pieces <a style="color:red;" href="https://www.openprocessing.org/user/90362">here</a>. If you'd like to try it out yourself, youll need to download the <a style="color:red;" href="https://p5js.org/download/">p5 software</a> and <a style="color:red;" href="http://brackets.io">brachets</a> for the IDE. Don't bother with the p5 IDE, it's still being developed (sort of buggy) and isn't always supported.
